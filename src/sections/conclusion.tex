TODO inventare qualcosa

In this survey, a short list of point cloud classification networks was made, highlighting the different approaches seen in literature.

Different networks use different methods to achieve the same properties needed for treating point clouds: permutation invariance and transformation invariance.


The neural networks described and the classification task tested on an easy, synthetic dataset might seem not really useful in real case applications. Instead, it is worth noting that the methods here described have paved the way of the more difficult tasks described in section \ref{sec:intro}.
For example we can see from the survey by Zhang et al \cite{ZHANG2020222} some neural networks that do point cloud registration are based on the methods described above: PointNetLK \cite{pointnetlk} is based on PointNet, DeepVCP \cite{deepvcp} is based on PointNet++, DCP\cite{dcp} is based on DGCNN.
